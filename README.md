Architecture Pattern used: MVVM 
Reason for using MVVM is to demonstrate how MVVM works. Using MVVM, we can delegate the UI login responsibility of ViewController to ViewModel. In MVVM, ViewController only passes to and fetches data from ViewModel, while in MVC, all the UI logic responsibility is handled by ViewController, which makes code look clumsy as well.
