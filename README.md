# WikiMedia

WikiMedia is an app which provides user the ease of searching images. All user have to do is write the name for which they want to see images in search bar, and relevant images will be displayed. Upon touching/clicking any image, the image will be shown in full page view on next screen. User can navigate back to screen which shows grid of images.

Architecture Pattern used: MVVM 
Reason for using MVVM is to demonstrate how MVVM works. Using MVVM, we can delegate the UI login responsibility of ViewController to ViewModel. In MVVM, ViewController only passes to and fetches data from ViewModel, while in MVC, all the UI logic responsibility is handled by ViewController, which makes code look clumsy as well.
